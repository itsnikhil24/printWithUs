# ü•ÅIntroduction

PrintWithUs is a web application designed to streamline the process of placing and managing printing orders, especially in college environments. Users can easily submit print orders with specific details through the app, and shopkeepers receive them in real-time, reducing the hassle and back-and-forth communication.


## üí°Inspiration:


-  The frequent hassle students face when getting documents printed at college shops.
-  Long queues and miscommunication between customers and shopkeepers.
-  Delays and confusion over order details often lead to frustration on both sides.
-  Aiming to save time and reduce unnecessary hassle by digitizing the printing order workflow.
  
## üí¨ What it does:

-  Create Printing Orders: Users can submit a PDF along with preferences such as timeslot, printing type (color or black and white), number of copies, binding, and paper size.
-  Secure Payments: Orders are paid for using a card, ensuring that only genuine orders are placed.
-  Instant Order Submission: Once the order is submitted, shopkeepers receive it immediately for processing.
-  Simplified Process: The platform eliminates the need for manual order handling, ensuring a seamless experience for both customers and shopkeepers.


## üõ† How we built it

We built the application using EJS for rendering dynamic HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for client-side functionality. The server-side operations were handled by Node.js and Express, while MongoDB was used for database management.


## ‚ùóChallenges we ran into:

-  Uploading PDFs to MongoDB: Configuring GridFS to handle and store PDF files effectively.
-  Reflecting Files from OrderModel to ShopkeeperModel: Ensuring that files in the OrderModel were correctly referenced and accessible in the ShopkeeperModel.
